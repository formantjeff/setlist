# Development Status

## ✅ Completed Features
- Greyscale minimal design
- Band management (create/join bands)
- User authentication and profiles
- Song management (create, edit, delete)
- Song metadata (artist, notes, duration, tempo)
- Mobile-responsive design

## ❌ Issues to Fix

### 1. Image Upload Not Working
**Likely cause**: Supabase storage bucket `song-images` doesn't exist
**Solution**: 
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > Storage
2. Create new bucket named `song-images`
3. Make it public for viewing
4. Test upload again

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Reordering Not Implemented
**Status**: Foundation exists (position field in database) but UI interaction not implemented
**Next step**: Implement simple drag-and-drop or up/down arrow buttons

## 🔧 Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix image upload by creating storage bucket
2. Implement drag-and-drop reordering
3. Test all functionality

## 📝 Notes
- Database position field already exists
- Error handling for image upload is implemented
- Mobile image capture is configured
